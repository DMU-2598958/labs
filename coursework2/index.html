        <p class="OHp">The Évora regional group emerged in February 2019 when some of its members became aware
          that the international movement <a href="https://fridaysforfuture.org/">#FridaysForFuture</a> and <a href="https://globalclimatestrike.net/">#SchoolStrike4Climate</a> had also been created in <!--Inside the anchor element, an HTML attribute was used to tell the browser where to navigate to, in this case, the #FridaysForFuture and #SchoolStrike4Climate pages.-->
          Portugal under the name of Greve Climática Estudantil (Student Climate Strike).
          The international movement began in August 2018, after Greta Thunberg and other young
          activists sat in front of the Swedish parliament to protest against the
          lack of action on the climate crisis. She posted what she was doing on Social Media and it
          soon went viral.

          <img id="earth" src="img/svg/earth.svg" alt="earth">
        </div>
        <p class="OHp2">Currently, the movement has been making contact with other national and international
          collectives and joining more fights, more specifically the feminist, the LGBTQ+ community,
          the anti-fascist, the anti-racist, the cause for the rights of students, and the fair energy transition.
          Therefore, the movement has been expanding its goals.</p>
