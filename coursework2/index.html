        <p class="WWDp2">"We are fighting for our future and our lives because they are directly threatened by the
          climate crisis and the ecological breakdown. We are taking action against it because we want to protect
          the beauty of the earth, the diversity of species and the lives of all beings. Our goal is to overcome the
          climate crisis and to create a society that lives in harmony with its fellow beings and its environment."</p>

        <h1 class="OH">Our history:</h1>
        <p class="OHp">The Évora regional group emerged in February 2019 when some of its members became aware
          that the international movement <a href="https://fridaysforfuture.org/">#FridaysForFuture</a> and <a href="https://globalclimatestrike.net/">#SchoolStrike4Climate</a> had also been created in
          Portugal under the name of Greve Climática Estudantil (Student Climate Strike).
          The internacional movement began in August 2018, after Greta Thunberg and other young
          activists sat in front of the Swedish parliament to protest against the
          lack of action on the climate crisis. She posted what she was doing on Social Media and it
          soon went viral.

          <img id="innertext" src="img/svg/innertext.svg" alt="There is no Planet B!">
          <img id="outertext" src="img/svg/outertext.svg" alt="There is no Planet B!">
          <img id="earth" src="img/svg/earth.svg" alt="earth">
        </div>
        <p class="OHp2">Currently, the movement has been making contact with other national and international
          collectives and joining more fights, more specifically the feminist, the LGBTQ+ community,
          the anti-fascist, the anti-racist, the cause for the rights of students, and the fair energy transition.
          Therefore, the movement has been expanding its goals.</p>
