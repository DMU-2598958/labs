        <h1>Movie Synopsis</h1>
        <p class="synopsis">1917 tells the story of two British soldiers, in World War I, tasked with stopping a battalion from walking into a German ambush. </p>
	<p class="synopsis">On April 6th, 1917, the aerial reconnaissance of the British army noticed that the Germany army was not in retreat but making a strategic withdraw.
  Tom Blake is ordered by General Erinmore to, along with Will Schofield, deliver a message to Colonel Mackenzie of the Second Battalion of the Devonshire
  Regiment warning them about the German attack that could kill 1.600, including Tom’s brother. </p>
	<p class="synopsis">“Schofield and Blake cross no man's land to reach the abandoned German trenches. In an underground barracks, they discover a booby-trap tripwire,
  which is promptly triggered by a rat. The explosion almost kills Schofield, but Blake saves him, and the two escape. They arrive at an abandoned farmhouse,
  where they witness a German plane being shot down. Schofield and Blake drag the burned pilot from the plane. However, the pilot stabs Blake and is shot dead
  by Schofield. Schofield comforts Blake as he dies, promising to complete the mission and to write to Blake's mother. Schofield is then picked up by a passing
  British unit. </p>
	<p class="synopsis">A destroyed canal bridge near Écoust-Saint-Mein prevents the British lorries from crossing, Schofield chooses to part with them at the bridge. He then
  uses what is left of the bridge to cross alone, and quickly comes under fire from a German sniper. He and the sniper shoot each other simultaneously;
  the sniper is killed, while Schofield is knocked unconscious. He regains consciousness at night and finds the town in flames. He is discovered by German
  soldiers, who open fire. Schofield escapes the soldiers by hiding in the basement of an abandoned building, and stumbles into the hiding place of a French
  woman with an infant. She treats his wounds, but, despite her pleas, Schofield leaves soon after, realising that time is not on his side. Being chased by
  more German soldiers, he escapes by jumping into a river. He is swept over a waterfall before reaching the riverbank by morning. In the forest, he finds
  Second Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment, which is in the last wave of the attack. As the company starts to move toward the front, Schofield tries to
  reach Colonel Mackenzie. </p>
	<p class="synopsis">Realising that the trenches are too crowded for him to make it to Mackenzie in time, Schofield sprints across the battlefield, just as the infantry begins
  its charge. He forces his way into meeting Mackenzie, who reads the message and reluctantly calls off the attack. Schofield is told that Joseph, Tom’s
  brother was in the first wave, and he searches for him among the wounded, finding him unscathed. Joseph is upset to hear of his brother's death, but thanks
  Schofield for his efforts. Schofield gives Joseph his brother's rings and dog tag and asks to write to their mother about Blake's heroics, to which Joseph
  agrees. Schofield sits under a tree, looking at photographs of his wife and two daughters.”
