          In 2012, he played the main character, Private Tommo Peaceful, in Private Peaceful, and appeared as a paralyzed soldier in the inspirational film The Best of Men. When
          he was 17, MacKay unsuccessfully auditioned for admission both to RADA (the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art) and to LAMDA (the London Academy of Music and
          Dramatic Art).</p>
          <p class="pcast">In the 2016 film Captain Fantastic, MacKay portrayed Bodevan, eldest son of Ben Cash. In 2017, he played Jack, the main character

            Ned Kelly in True History of the Kelly Gang directed by Justin Kurzel. (...) MacKay played the lead role of Lance corporal William Schofield, a young
            British World War I soldier in 1917, directed by Sam Mendes. 1917 was nominated for Best Picture in the 92nd Academy Awards, along with
