    <li>In a big bowl, sift together the dry ingredients (Flour, Cocoa, Sugar, Baking Soda, Salt) and mix until combined.</li>
    <li>Pour the cake batter in a greased and lined 20 cm - 8 inch cake pan; bake in preheated oven at 180Â°C for about 40 minutes (or until a toothpick comes out clean).</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven, let cool slightly then remove the cake from the pan and cool down completely on a wire rack.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile prepare the chocolate ganache. Chop the chocolate and place it in a heat proof bowl.</li>
    <li>Place the whipping cream in a small saucepan and heat until almost starts boiling at the edges (don't bring it to a full boil).</li>
    <li>Pour the hot whipping cream onto the chopped chocolate, let sit for 1-2 minutes then stir until melted and smooth. If the ganache is too runny, you can wait for few minutes before place it on top of the cake.</li>
    <li>Place the ganache on top of the cake and decorate with a spoon to create whirls or flower shape.</li>
    <li>Let the ganache set a bit at room temperature before serving.</li>
    <li>Enjoy :))</li>
