    <h1 id=polar-bear>Polar Bear</h1>
    <p>URSUS MARITIMUS <br> Polar bears are the planet’s biggest land-based carnivores – although they actually spend most of their lives around water and ice (their Latin name means ‘sea bear’).
      So they’re at particular risk from global warming, which is melting the Arctic sea ice they depend on. Polar bears generally live and hunt alone, though they can be quite social too. They mainly eat seals
      – using their remarkable sense of smell they can detect a seal in the water beneath a metre of compacted snow, and from almost a kilometre away.</p>
      <img src="img/Polar_Bear.jpg" alt="Polar Bear">
      <p>Adults are strong swimmers – they can swim for several hours to get from one piece of ice to another.
        Their thick white coat and a layer of fat keep them warm and camouflaged in their harsh Arctic environment.
        It’s hard to imagine such impressive, powerful predators being vulnerable,
        but man-made climate change is making life tough for them – so their fate could be in our hands. We mustn’t let them down.</p>

    <h1 id=sea-turtle>Sea Turtle</h1>
    <p>ERETMOCHELYS IMBRICATA <br> Marine turtles have been in our oceans for over 100 million years. They’re brilliant navigators, swimming hundreds or thousands of kilometres between feeding and nesting grounds.
      But they face lots of threats along the way – so we’re doing all we can to help them.</p>
    <img src="img/Sea_Turtle.jpg" alt="Baby Sea Turle">
    <p>Marine turtle population estimates (including those stated above) are based on the number of egg-laying females – we can’t be sure of the numbers of elusive sea-dwelling males, or females that aren’t breeding.
      But we do know at least six of the seven species are at risk of extinction.</p>

    <h1 id=bornean-orangutan>Bornean Orangutan</h1>
    <p>PONGO PYGMAEUS <br>Bornean orangutan populations have declined by more than 50% over the past 60 years,
      and the species' habitat has been reduced by at least 55% over the past 20 years.</p>
      <img src="img/Orangutan.jpg" alt="Bornean Orangutan">
      <p>The Bornean orangutan differs in appearance from the Sumatran orangutan, with a broader face and shorter beard and also slightly darker in color.
       Three subspecies are recognized, each localized to different parts of the island:
   <ul>
    <li>Northwest Bornean orangutans are the most threatened subspecies. Its habitat has been seriously affected by logging and hunting, and a mere 1,500 individuals or so remain.
    Many habitat patches in the area are small and fragmented.</li>
    <li>Northeast Bornean orangutans are the smallest in size and found in Sabah and eastern Kalimantan as far as the Mahakam River.</li>
    <li>Central Bornean orangutans are the subspecies with the most animals, with at least 35,000 individuals.</li>
   </ul>

    <h1 id=african-lion>African Lion</h1>
    <p>PANTHERO LEO <br>Powerful and majestic, the king of the beasts has no natural predators. But unthinkably,
      African lion numbers have plummeted by over 40% in the last three generations, due to loss of living space and conﬂict with people.Lions
      are the most sociable of all big cats. They live in groups called prides, which usually consist of related females and their cubs.
      Dominant males, with their flowing manes (a sign of virility), fight to maintain breeding rights.</p>
      <img src="img/African_Lion.jpg" alt="African Lion">
      <p>Three-quarters of African lion populations are in decline. With only around 20,000 in the wild,
        they’re now officially classified as ‘vulnerable’.</p>

    <h1 id=indian-elefant>Indian Elefant</h1>
    <p>ELEPHAS MAXIMUS INDICUS <br> Asian elephants once roamed across most of Asia, now they’re restricted to just 15% of their original range,
      in a number of fragmented and isolated populations around south and south-east Asia. Asian elephants are not quite as big as their
      African cousins, and have proportionally smaller ears. They’re generally dark grey to brown but often have pink or yellow marks on their face,
      ears and trunk.</p>
      <img src="img/Indian_Elephant.jpg" alt="Indian Elephant">
      <p>Female Asian elephants are more social than males. They live in herds with their female relatives.
        Males usually live alone but sometimes form small groups with other males. Living in some of the most densely populated parts of
        the world has brought challenges – Asian elephant numbers have roughly halved in the last three elephant generations.
        We need your help to make them thrive again.</p>
